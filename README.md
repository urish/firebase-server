Installation
------------

You can install firebase-server through npm:

`npm install --save-dev firebase-server`

Usage Example
-------------

```js
var FirebaseServer = require('firebase-server');

new FirebaseServer(5000, 'localhost.firebaseio.test', {
	states: {
		CA: 'California',
		AL: 'Alabama',
		KY: 'Kentucky'
	}
});
```

After running this server, you can create a Firebase client instance that connects to it:

```js
var client = new Firebase('ws://localhost.firebaseio.test:5000');
client.on('value', function(snap) {
	console.log('Got value: ', snap.val());
});
```

Don't forget to point the host `localhost.firebaseio.test` to your local IP address (in `/etc/hosts` or similar).

For more information, read the [blog post in the offical Firebase blog](https://www.firebase.com/blog/2015-04-24-end-to-end-testing-firebase-server.html).

### Command Line Interface

This package installs a CLI script called `firebase-server`. The following command will
start a firebase server on port 5555:

	node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -p 5555
	
To bootstrap the server with some data you can use the `-d,--data` or the `-f,--file` option. 
_Note: The file option will override the data option._
	
	node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -d '{"foo": "bar"}'
	
	node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -f ./path/to/data.json
	
To load [Firebase Security rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security/) upon startup you can use the `-r,--rules` option. 
	
	node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -r ./path/to/rules.json
	
For more information, run:

	node_modules/.bin/firebase-server -h

### FirebaseServer methods

FirebaseServer instances have the following API:

* `close(callback)` - Stops the server (closes the server socket) and then calls the callback
* `getValue()` - Returns a promise that will be resolved with the current data on the server
* `exportData()` - Returns a promise that will be resolved with the current data on the server, including priority values.
	This is similar to [DataSnapshot.exportVal()](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/datasnapshot/exportval.html).
* `setRules(rules)` - Sets the security rules for the server. Uses the [targaryen](https://github.com/goldibex/targaryen)
	library for rule validation.
* `setAuthSecret(secret)` - Sets the shared secret used for validating [Custom Authentication Tokens](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/guide/login/custom.html).
* `setTime(timestamp)` - Sets the server time. The server time is returned by [ServerValue.TIMESTAMP](https://www.firebase.com/docs/web/api/servervalue/timestamp.html)
    and is also used for checking the validity of Custom Authentication Tokens.

### Debug logging

This project uses the excellent [`debug`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug) module for logging.
It is configured by setting an environment variable:

```sh
$ DEBUG=* mocha                                # log everything
$ DEBUG=firebase-server* mocha                 # log everything from firebase-server
$ DEBUG=firebase-server:token-generator mocha  # log output from specific submodule
```

Advanced options are available from the [`debug docs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug)
